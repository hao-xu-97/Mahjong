# Mahjong

The purpose of this project is to teach new players the basics of the game. There are 2 main modes of this project currently which are tutorial and practice.

In tutorial, there will be step by step instructions on how a game of mahjong works. It will walk through an example game and explain the actions taken at each step of the game. This example game is scripted so the player will only need to follow along. Hopefully, by going through this mode, the player will have a basic understanding of how the game works.

In practice, the player will use what he/she learned in the tutorial and try to win without instructions. There aren't actually any opponents in this mode, but a game will be simulated for the player for practicing. There will be no way for a player to lose in practice mode, at worse it will be a draw.

Future goals including:

* implementing game ai
* polish up the interface
* add multiplayer support
* add cross platform support
